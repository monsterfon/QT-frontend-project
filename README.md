# FrontEnd Qt Project

This repository contains my first **extensive project** created using **Python** and **Qt**. It represents a major milestone in my programming journey, being the first big project that allowed me to delve into various important concepts, particularly in the context of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** and building a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.

## Project Overview
This project involved developing a fully functional application from scratch. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience where I learned a lot about **input validation**, **sanitization**, and **UI/UX** design. 

### Key Features:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: The application features a clean and user-friendly interface built using **Qt**.
- **Input Validation**: I implemented stringent **input sanitization** to ensure that users could not inject harmful or invalid data. This process was crucial in maintaining the integrity of the program.
- **Range Constraints**: During the development, I researched and set the proper **minimum and maximum values** for user inputs to ensure the application functioned within safe parameters.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project was organized using object-oriented principles. It involved **overriding objects**, using **polymorphism**, and creating a clean and maintainable structure with a large number of files—about **50 files**, each working together to build the application.

### Technologies and Tools Used:
- **Python**: The core programming language for the application.
- **Qt**: Used to build the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Employed throughout the project with concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **File Management**: The project involved creating and organizing numerous files in a way that helped manage complexity, with many files nested within each other.

## Project Challenges and Learnings
- **Input Sanitization**: One of the key learning experiences was ensuring that all user inputs were properly sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
- **Researching Constraints**: I spent considerable time researching the proper **range constraints** for user inputs to ensure that they were both meaningful and functional within the application.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: With so many files, I had to focus on clean and efficient object-oriented design to keep the project maintainable. It was an excellent exercise in applying OOP principles.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that you have **Python** and **Qt** installed.
3. Run the main Python script to launch the application.
4. Interact with the GUI and test the functionality, ensuring the inputs are validated and sanitized properly.

This project was a significant learning experience, as it was my first **large-scale application** that combined **Python programming**, **Qt GUI development**, and a solid **object-oriented design** approach. I’m particularly proud of the final result, which successfully met the requirements and provided me with valuable experience that I continue to apply in future projects.
